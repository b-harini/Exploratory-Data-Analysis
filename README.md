# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank's customer dataset to predict customer churn. Churn prediction is crucial for banks to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank. Through various statistical techniques and visualizations, the dataset is analyzed to uncover insights that can guide business decisions and customer retention strategies.

Key Objectives

Understand the distribution and relationships between various features such as Credit Score, Age, Balance, and Estimated Salary.

Identify significant factors that contribute to customer churn.

Visualize patterns to make data-driven decisions for better customer retention strategies.

Analysis Highlights

Credit Score & Churn:

No significant difference in credit score distribution between retained and churned customers.

Age & Churn:

Older customers tend to churn more, suggesting a difference in service preference among age groups.

Tenure & Churn:

Customers with very short or very long tenures are more likely to churn compared to those with average tenure.

Balance & Churn:

The bank is losing customers with significant bank balances, potentially impacting available capital for lending.

Estimated Salary & Products:

Neither salary nor the number of products owned by customers shows a significant impact on churn.

Tools Used

Python

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
